#A Moudlar Quantum Compilation Framework for Distributed Quantum Computing
I have tried to implement various parts of the Research Paper - "A Moudlar Quantum Compilation Framework for Distributed Quantum Computing". 
1. Qubits assignment (an optimal partitioning of the monolithic Quantum circuit and representing it in the form of weighted undirected Graph)
2. Remote Gate Scheduler (Ordering the execution of Remote Gates)
